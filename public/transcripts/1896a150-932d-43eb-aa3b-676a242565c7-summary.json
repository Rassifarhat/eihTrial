  "chief_complaint": "Back pain for about one week not improved with medication.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient reports approximately 1 week of back pain that has not responded to their current medication. Patient requests additional testing because they suspect a disc or other structural cause. No additional details provided about pain characteristics, neurological symptoms, prior episodes, or exact treatments tried.",
  "assessment": "Back pain of one week duration refractory to current medication. Differential includes mechanical back pain versus possible disc/structural pathology (patient concerned). Insufficient information to confirm diagnosis or assess for neurological compromise.",
  "plan": "1) Obtain focused history and perform physical and neurological exam. 2) Review current medications and doses; consider analgesic dose adjustment as appropriate. 3) If clinical suspicion for disc disease or red flags present, obtain imaging (consider lumbar spine MRI if available; X-ray if indicated). 4) Consider referral to spine specialist or physiotherapy based on findings. 5) Provide return precautions (worsening pain, new numbness/weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction) and arrange follow-up after testing or sooner if symptoms worsen.",
