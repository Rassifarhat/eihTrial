  "chief_complaint": "Low back pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient reports mild low back pain for about two weeks. Pain began after lifting a very heavy object. Patient denies falling or slipping. No other details about pain characteristics, neurological symptoms, or prior treatments were provided in the conversation.",
  "assessment": "Most consistent with acute mechanical low back pain/strain related to heavy lifting. No documented red flag symptoms in the transcript, but neurologic review and full exam are not available.",
  "plan": "Perform focused physical examination including neurologic testing (strength, sensation, reflexes) and assess for red flags. Recommend conservative management: activity modification/avoid heavy lifting, consider NSAIDs if appropriate, and referral to physical therapy if persistent. Reserve imaging (e.g., lumbar X-ray or MRI) for presence of red flags or lack of improvement/worsening. Advise patient to seek immediate care for worsening pain, new numbness/weakness, or bowel/bladder changes.",
  "follow_up": "Re-evaluate with clinician if no improvement within ~2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen or new neurologic or systemic symptoms develop.",
