Don't worry—I don't think there's a problem, but to be sure let's do X-rays, especially since you're about 40 years old and that age can sometimes be associated with a herniated (slipped) disc after lifting something. So let's do the X-rays first to make sure everything is okay, and based on the images we'll decide what to do."
